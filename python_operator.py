# numerical operators in python

# + for addition
# - for substraction
# * for multiplication
# / for division with float part also
# // for division with integer part only
# ** for power  calculation
# % for modulus

x=5
y=3
print(" addition of x+y =",x+y)
print("substraction of x-y =",x-y)
print("multiplication of x*y =", x*y)
print("division of x/y =",x/y)
print("division of x//y =",x//y)
print("modulus of x%y =",x%y)
print("power of y  on x i.e; x**y =",x**y)

# some operations on string
str_data = "sunny"
empty_str =''

# concat operation for string
full_name = str_data + " " + "mishra"
print(" fullname is " ,full_name)

# if we can use - as well ? it will not work
# minus_str = "sunny" - "mishra"
# print("minus_str =",minus_str)

# multiply with  single *
mul_str = "sunny" * 3
print(mul_str)

# Assignment operators
# = , x=5
# += , x+=5 -> x= x+5
# -= , x-=5 -> x= x-5
# *= , x*=5 -> x= x*5
# /= , x/=5 -> x= x/5
# //= , x//=5 -> x= x//5
# %= , x%=5 -> x= x%5

# Comparison operators(in comparison operators we compare operands value)
# == , Equals to condition x==y
# != , Not equals to condition , x!=y
# > , greater than condition , x>y
# < , less than condition , x<y
# >= , greater than equals to condition,x>=y
# <= , less than equals to condition , x<=y

print("result of a<b",a<b)
print("result of a>=b",a>=b)
print("result of a<=b",a<=b)

# Logical operators(logical check will happen for expression result)
# and -> return true if both statement are true
# or -> returns true if one statement will true
# not -> reverse the result, return false if the result is  true
